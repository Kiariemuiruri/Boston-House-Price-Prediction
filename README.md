# Boston-House-Price-Prediction
The model is build on Random Forest to predict House Prices in Boston condtional on some features
![Forest Graph](https://github.com/Kiariemuiruri/Boston-House-Price-Prediction/blob/main/Forest.png)
* Random Forest generalized better than othe linear algorithms before tuning with a prediction accuracy of 84%
* After tuning the hyperparameters, the prediction accuracy improved to 89%
* The Algorithm can be deployed for consumption on the front-end using the Pickle file provided
